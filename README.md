     4. current pressure \
     5. hourly temperature (last 24 hours) \
     6. hourly humidity (last 24 hours) \
     7. hourly wind_speed (last 24 hours) \
     8. hourly pressure (last 24 hours) \
     10. Max and Min humidity in a day \
     11. Max and Min temperature in a day \
     12. Max and Min wind_speed in a day \
     13. Max and Min pressure in a day \
